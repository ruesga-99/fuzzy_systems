# Fuzzy Logic Systems
This repository contains different fuzzy expert systems applicable to IoT devices.
Each model considers factors differnet real-life continuous factors.

## Theory Behind Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic is a branch of mathematics and artificial intelligence that models uncertainty and imprecision in data. It is a powerful tool for representing and manipulating ambiguous concepts, making it ideal for systems requiring nuanced decision-making.

At its core, fuzzy logic relies on the concept of fuzzy sets, where elements have gradual membership functions. This allows an element to belong to multiple sets simultaneously, unlike classical binary logic that imposes strict boundaries. This flexibility makes fuzzy logic suitable for handling uncertainty in complex systems.

Fuzzy logic employs various operators and rules to manipulate fuzzy sets effectively. Common operators include conjunction, disjunction, and negation. Logical rules such as *modus ponens* and *modus tollens* further enhance the systemâ€™s ability to model complex behaviors.

### Classic Logic vs Fuzzy Logic

| Feature     | Classic Logic         | Fuzzy Logic              |
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Membership  | Binary (0 or 1)       | Gradual (0 to 1)         |
| Precision   | Strict and exact      | Flexible and approximate |
| Application | Well-defined problems | Real-world uncertainty   |   

### Mamdani Algorithm

The Mamdani algorithm is one of the most widely used fuzzy inference methods. It provides a framework for decision-making by applying fuzzy logic rules to input data and generating outputs that reflect real-world scenarios. This algorrithm includes the following steps:
1. Define input and output linguistic variables, including their numeric ranges and their membership functions (MF).
2. Define a set of rules that represents the control strategy for the system.
3. *Fuzzify* the input values, in this step each input value will be assigned to its category according to the defined membership functions and set of rules.
4. Analyze the inference to determine the strength of the activated rules.
5. *De-fuzzify* the output values using a center of gravity centroid and determine the action to be executed.

### Membership Functions

Membership functions define how each input maps to a degree of membership within a fuzzy set. Common types include:
- Triangular
  - Lambda Function
- Trapezoidal
  - Gamma Function
  - L-Function
- Gaussian
- Sigmoid

### Real Life Applications
Fuzzy systems are useful whenever a process has a high complexity and no precise mathematical models are availiable, thus
fuzzy systems are powerful tools in different indusrty-environments and IoT systems such as:
- Temperature control systems.
- Light control systems.
- Fuel efficiency systems.
- Robotic control applications.
- Autonomous driving.
- Writing systems.

> For more sophisticated applications, this repository links to a dedicated implementation of ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), a hybrid model that combines fuzzy logic with neural networks. ANFIS enhances traditional fuzzy systems by:
> - *Learning capability*: Automatically optimizes fuzzy rules and membership functions through training data.
> - *Adaptation*: Dynamically adjusts to changing environments, making it ideal for IoT systems with real-time data streams.
> - *Precision*: Balances interpretability (fuzzy logic) with predictive accuracy (neural networks).
