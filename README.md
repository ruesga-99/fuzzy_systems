# Fuzzy Logic Systems
This repository contains different fuzzy expert systems applicable to IoT devices.
Each model considers factors differnet real-life continuous factors.

Fuzzy logic is a branch of mathematical logic used to model uncertainty and imprecision in data. Fuzzy logic is a computing technique used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is based on the idea that results can be more imprecise and uncertain, but expressed more clearly. This systems defer from classical boolean logic and values take
place within a range between 0 and 1.

## Emoji Key
✅ (Completed): This emoji is used to mark tasks that have been finished and require no further work.

📆 (Planned): This emoji is used for tasks that are planned for the future, indicating they are on the work calendar. The corresponding file does not exist within the repository.

🚧 (Under Construction): This emoji indicates tasks that have been implemented but still need further improvements or adjustments. There is already a corresponding file within the repository but hasn't been fully developed.

💡 (Planning Ongoing): This emoji is used for sections that haven't been completely defined on their components.
