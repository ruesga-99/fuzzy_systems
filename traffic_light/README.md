# Fuzzy Traffic Light ðŸš¦
This directory contains a fuzzy expert system for a smart traffic light controller, which considers factors such as traffic density, time of the day and weather conditions (rain).

## Fuzzy Sets 
**Input: Traffic Density**

*Universe: [0 - 300] vehicles per hour*
- Low: [0, 100]
- Medium: [50, 200]
- High: [150, 300]

**Input: Time of Day**

*Universe: [6:00 - 20:00] hrs*
- Morning: [6:00, 8:00]
- PeakHours: [7:30, 9:00] & [17:00, 19:00]
- ValleyTime: [8:40, 17:15]
- Night: [18:00, 20:00]

**Input: Weather Conditions**

*Universe: [0 - 50] mm/hr*
- Light: [0, 5]
- Moderate: [0, 20]
- Heavy: [10, 50]

**Output: Traffic Light Time**

*Universe: [1 - 60] sec*
- Short: [1, 25]
- Medium: [20, 45]
- Long: [40, 60]
